#### _A program to simulate ordering pizza, 01/26/18_

#### _**Andy Grossberg**_

## Description

_This is the Friday Project for Week Four of Intro to Programming at Epicodus_

## Location

_You can find the files at https://www.github.com/agro23/pizza-order_

## Rules for the pizza ordering assignment:

Order Pizza

* Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.

* Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.

* Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.

* Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.

* Keep it simple to start! You do not need to have a complex formula for determining cost (although you can if you like). The most important part of this code review is using and demonstrating your understanding of constructors and prototypes.


## Methodology

# Describe the way I did it if there's time.

### _The following specs are included in the program:_

**Take input from the user for pizza (size and toppings)**
**display choice(s) back to them.**

* The program shows a pizza
  - Example Input: 0
  - Example Output: Beep!

* The program creates a Pizza object with sizes and toppings and a method to calculate the cost

* The program shows a pizza with a random sizes chosen from multiples.
  - Example Output: Here's your pizza: LARGE
  - Example Output: Here's your pizza: SMALL etc.

* The program shows a pizza with a random topping chosen from multiples.
  - Example Output: Here's your pizza: PEPPERONI
  - Example Output: Here's your pizza: PINEAPPLE

* The program shows the cost of sample pizzas based on a scratch formula
  - Example Input:
  - Example Output:

* The program accepts user input to alter the size (Input via a form with submit)
  - Example Input:
  - Example Output:

* The program accepts user input to alter the topping choice (Input via a form with submit)
  - Example Input:
  - Example Output:

* The program lets the user pick multiple toppings (Input via a form with submit)
  - Example Input:
  - Example Output:

* The user's choices are displayed to an appropriate Output panel

* Output results formatted to look nicer

* Choices are in selector checkboxes

* page uses images for ingredients

* Refactor code and clean up code

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Download the files from the repository into appropriately named directories.
* Open the files with the browser of your choice.

## Known Bugs

_There are no known issues at this time. However, the program does not catch non-number input._

## Support and contact details

## Technologies Used

_Uses HTML, CSS, javascript, and jQuery._
